      <p className="about-content">
        Lynx is a clothing brand made just for women. We believe that every woman
        should feel strong, confident, and comfortable in what she wears. Our
        clothes are designed to match your lifestyle — whether you're working,
        relaxing, or going out.
      </p>

      <h2 className="content-heading">Our Mission</h2>
      <p className="about-content">
        We want to help women feel good about themselves. That means offering
        clothes that are stylish, easy to wear, and made with care. We also care
        about the planet and choose materials that are better for the environment.
      </p>

      <h2 className="content-heading">Made for Women, by Women</h2>
      <p className="about-content">
        Lynx is run by women who understand what other women need. We know that
        clothes should fit well, feel good, and make life easier — not harder.
        That’s why every piece we create is made with real women in mind.
